MiniVM - A Really Simple Virtual Machine
========================================

This is a really simple stack-based virtual machine written in Ruby.

It exists mainly because I wanted to learn more about Ruby.

I'm also thinking it might be a useful way to demonstrate programming
language concepts, such as how to translate an expression into
a sequence of instructions to evaluate the expression.

Usage
=====

To assemble a MiniVM assembly language program into an executable:

	./Assembler.rb asmfile exefile

To execute an executable file generated by the assembler:

	./Execute.rb exefile

For example, to try the hello world program:

	./Assembler.rb t/hello.mvm hello.out
	./Execute.rb hello.out

Technical Details
=================

Documentation.md contains a technical description of MiniVM.

Details of the assembly language can be learned by looking at the
programs in the `t` directory.

Limitations
===========

There are probably lots of bugs.

The diagnostics when error conditions are encountered are inadequate.

More error checking is needed.
